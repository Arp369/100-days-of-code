# Brand Name Generator Project

Welcome to the **Brand Name Generator** project! This simple Python application prompts the user for their city and pet's name and then combines them to generate a brand name. Along with this main feature, the repository includes basic examples for understanding Python concepts like user input, string operations, and working with variables.

## Project Description

This project showcases basic Python functionality to help beginners learn how to interact with the user, process strings, and perform some elementary operations with variables. The main application is the **Brand Name Generator**, which creates a brand name by asking the user for their city and pet's name.

## Python Functions

### User Input and Greeting

The first file demonstrates basic user input functionality using `input()`:

```python
#Python Functions

## The line of code that will take input from the user, using the input() FUNCTION.
name = input("What's your name?\n")
print("Hello " + name)

#Optimal way of doing it
print("Hello " + input("What's your name?")+"!")
```

### String Operations

The second file shows how to work with strings, including adding newlines and joining strings:

```python
# Write your code below

#Adding a string in a new line
print("Hello world! \nHello world@")
print("Another Practice \nfor this string \noperations")

#Join two different strings.
print("Hello"+" Arpan")
```

### Understanding Variables

The third file introduces the use of the `len()` function to count the length of input:

```python
# understanding the variables.
## understand the len() function to count length
name = print(len(input("What's your name? \n")))
```

## Brand Name Generator

This is the main feature of the project. The user is prompted for their city and pet's name, and a brand name is generated by combining the two.

```python
# Brand Name Generator Project

print("Welcome to Brand Name Generator!")
city = input("What's name of the city you grew up in?\n")
pet = input("What's your pet's name?\n")

print("Your Brand Name could be " + city + " " + pet + ".")
```

## How to Run the Code

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the Python script by typing:

   ```bash
   python brand_name_generator.py
   ```

5. Follow the prompts to input your city and pet's name, and the program will generate a brand name for you.
